# SwiftVisa

##  Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered visa eligibility screening agent that evaluates whether a user may qualify for a given visa type, based entirely on structured user inputs and a pre-curated policy knowledge base. All reasoning is performed by a generative AI model grounded in immigration policy documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
