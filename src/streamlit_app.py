"""
Bootstrap wrapper for Streamlit that safely loads the main `app.py` UI.

This loader will read `app.py`, strip surrounding Markdown/``` fences if they
exist (some files were saved with code fences), then execute the resulting
Python source. This preserves the original `app.py` file while allowing
`streamlit run streamlit_app.py` to work even when `app.py` contains fences.
